# Investment-Management-with-Python-and-Machine-Learning
You find here some of my projects based on the Investment Mangagement course by EDHEC Business School

Project : Develop a risk kit for investment mangement
Programmation language : Python on Jupyter Notebook

### 1 - Risk and Returns
- Calculate Return, Risk adjudted return and Volatility

### 2 - Drawdown
- Compute Maximum Drawdown of return series and drawdown function

### 3 - Building module
- Create a module which will act as a risk toolkit that we will add our function later

### 4 - Deviations from Normality
- Develop the code for skewness and kurtosis (also available in scipy.stats)
- Jarque-Beta test for Normality (scipy.stats)

### 5 - Downside Measures : Semi-Deviation, VaR and CVaR
- Compute Semi-Deviation
- Compute VaR and CVaR : Historic, Parametric Gaussian, Modified (Cornish-Fisher) VaR

### 6 - Efficient Frontier
- Compute the Efficient Frontier for N-Asset when we have a set of expected returns, volatilities and correlations
- Compute annualized sharpe ratio

### 7 - Markowitz
- Finding the Max Sharpe Ratio Portfolio
- Lack of Robustness of Markowitz procedure
- Global Minimum Variance (GMV) portfolio and Equal Weighted portfolio

### 8 - Limit of Diversification
- Take a look at why diversification isn't helpful in market crashes

### 9 - Portfolio Insurance CPPI and Drawdown Constraints
- Implementing Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance dynamic risk budgeting algorithm
- Use drawdown to adjust the floor of CPPI algorithm

### 10 - Random Walk and Monte Carlo
- Implement Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)

### 11 - Interactive plots for Monte Carlo simulation of CPPI and GBM
- Plotting an interactive Monte Carlo simulation of CPPI and GBM using ipywidgets

### 12 - Present Value of Liabilities and Funding Ratio
- Compute the present value of future liabilities and measure the funding ratio

### 13 - CIR model and Cash vs Zero-Coupon Bonds
- Implementing the Cox Ingersoll Ross model for Interest Rates, interactive with ipywidgets
- Generate the random price evolution of a Zero-Coupon Bond by CIR model
- Terminal Funding Ratio
- Hedging a future liability with cash or ZC Bond

### 14 - Liability driven investing
- Construct a Goal Hedging Portfolio with Duration Matching

### 15 - Monte Carlo simulation of Coupon-Bearing bonds using CIR
- Simulate prices of a Coupon-bearing Bond
- Monte Carlo Simulation of Asset Allocation

### 16 - Naive Risk Budgeting Strategies between Performance Seek Portfolio (PSP) and Goal Hedging Portfolio (GHP)
- Compute the returns of a portfolio that mixes a PSP with a GHP by differents strategies : fixed mix allocation, glide path allocation
- Compute Distribution of Terminal Values and mesure risk budgeting efficiency

### 17 - Dynamic Risk Budgeting between PSP and GHP
- Use CPPI to ensure that the account value reaches a certain target minimum floor and maintain exposure to the upside through a dynamic risk budget
- Use floor allocator to allocate more to the PSP when there is a cushion
- Implement Dynamic Risk budgeting with drawdown instead of a fixed floor
- Backtest with historical data
